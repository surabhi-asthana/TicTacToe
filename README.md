The game includes a player setup page where users can enter their names before starting the match.

## Features

 Two-player gameplay (X and O)

Score tracking (stored in sessionStorage)

Different color themes for each player’s turn

Automatic game stop when someone wins or when it’s a draw

New game button to start a new game without changing the scores

## How to Play

Enter Player 1 and Player 2 names

Click Start Game → you’ll be redirected to tic.html
